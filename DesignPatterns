Design patterns :
1- Strategy : we can use it for moving objects from/to sides, objects have to implement it.
2- Singleton : we can use it when creating single objects like the boat.
3- Command : we can use it when a user press a button on gui or something like that.
4- MVC :
5- Observer : we can use it to notify objects/things when the object/thing they are following updates something
              like when u move the boat from a side to another we notify the label that shows the score that
              the boat moved so it will increase the score by 1.
6- Factory : we can use it to put the if conditions like when we want to create a a farmer we will create it using
             the factory design pattern, we will have one class containing the possible options.
7- Memento : we can use it for anything related to an object's history like its state before certain event happens
             (undo/redo).
8- Iterator: idk where to use it, we can talk about it later ^^.

- To use the boat singleton, just use
  Boat boat = Boat.getInstance();
- The doMove method will use the strategy design pattern
  doMove(..){
  Move move;
   if(fromLeftToRightBank){
        move = new Move(new MoveLeftToRight())
        move.doMove(..)
   }
   else{
        move = new Move(new MoveRightToLeft())
        move.doMove(..)
   }
  }
- Undo/redo will use the memento design pattern
    everytime the user make a move, we will add the list of both riversides to the memento
    History history = new History();
    to save a move : history.createHistory(leftList, RightList)
    to undo a move : history.undo() which will set the private instances to the previous lists, so will get them using
                     getters.
    to redo a move : history.redo() and works the same as undo but with the redo logic.

- Creation of a level will work as follows:
    LevelCreator levelCreator = new LevelCreator;
    Level level = levelCreator.getLevel(x) // x = level's number
